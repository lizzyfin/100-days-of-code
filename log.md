# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6: January 6, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Read and worked through GitHub 'Hello World' Guide to see how commits and pull requests work. Now, I've updated and logged my progress here.

Read the Introduction and first two chapters of http://eloquentjavascript.net/. Also completed exercises at the end of Chapter 2: Looping a triangle, FizzBuzz, and Chess board. Figured I needed some 'back to basics' as I was having some confusion with functions and callbacks in a general sense.

**Thoughts:** Really cool code editor within and among the text of eloquentjavascript which encourages the reader to "consume" the coding examples by making changes to the given code and see how the output changes in response. Love the style of writing! Good progress was made today on basic JS.

### Day 2: January 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Random Quote Generator

**Thoughts**: Took a while to figure out it's harder to convert XML output to JSON, so will read up and re-do.

**Link(s) to work**: signed up to mashape.com via github account to work with APIs


### Day 1: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Joined Twitter as @FinLizzy5. Following fellow 100DaysofCode FCCers, among others.

**Thoughts** I started Free Code Camp in November 2016 and have really enjoyed my progress so far. Just started the Intermediate Front End Dev Projects which should jive with 100 Days of Coding!

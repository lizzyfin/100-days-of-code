# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 17: January 24, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Messed around with CSS for FCC Weather App by making background change color based on sunrise time, among a few other things.

**Thoughts:**  This weather app is a page that could be further improved as it's pretty simple as far as the information it's sharing on the screen. Future versions could include a means for the user to enter their location more precisely as their IP is currently used to detect their location.

### Day 16: January 23, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Got the celsius to fahrenheit temp conversion working for my FCC Weather App which satisfies the third user story. Presentation at this point is a too basic black on white with a single icon.

**Thoughts:**  Learned about .toPrecision and Math.round for presenting numbers without all those digits.

### Day 15: January 20, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on local weather project on CodePen. Got most of the numbers showing up and converted to meaningful values. Next to work on presentation.

**Thoughts:**  Learned about using the results from one API to feed into a second API on the same page.

### Day 14: January 19, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on local weather project on CodePen. 

**Thoughts:**  Knowing how to properly use the output of an API seems really powerful. Can't wait to fully understand this.

### Day 13: January 18, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started to map out the data needed for local weather project on CodePen. Viewed a video from WordPress Camp "Noel Tock: Beyond the Code" which was quite inspiring.

**Thoughts:**  Look forward to more great stuff from Noel.

### Day 12: January 17, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Wasn't able to spend much time on local weather project other than thinking about the tasks needed to complete. Signed up for view Practical Javascript course from Gordon Zhu.

**Thoughts:** Really like Gordon's voice and approach to his Practical JS training videos. Looking forward to learning more about JS from him.

### Day 11: January 16, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Wasn't able to spend much time on local weather project other than thinking about the tasks needed to complete.

**Thoughts:** Will have to deal with API again. Have to get better at keeping up with updating this log file!

**Link to work:** No link to share today.


### Day 10: January 15, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started organizing thoughts and outlined needs for FCC Show the Local Weather mini-project.

**Thoughts:** Will have to deal with API again. Have to get better at keeping up with updating this log file!

**Link to work:** No link to share today.


### Day 9: January 13, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Random Quote Machine for FCC was completed.

**Thoughts:** Really cool to see data coming in from an external site via API at the click of a button. Also, it's pretty nice to be able to make a Tweet on the fly!

### Day 8: January 12, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Tweet functionaliy added to Random Quote Machine for FCC. Learned about adding Google Fonts via link in HTML head and font-family in CSS. Selected typeface pairs via http://fontpair.co/. Learned about Font Awesome and how to show page refresh and twitter icons.

**Thoughts:** CSS is kinda fun, but messing around with it can suck up time!

### Day 7: January 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: CORS issue work around for Quote Machine was a simple alert stating that the CodePen must be viewed from http:// in order to see a quote. This is because the API for quotes is using http://. 

**Thoughts:** Would like to use a different solution instead of the cludgy alert. Still, the quote machine works! Need to make the tweet part functional.

### Day 6: January 10, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Erased previous efforts and took a fresh start for Building a Random Quote Machine at CodePen. Learned about CORS but couldn't get around the http:// vs. https:// issue. Read chapter 5 of http://eloquentjavascript.net/ and I'm getting a little caught up in the 'lingo' which is not cemented in my understanding, yet.

**Thoughts:** Exercises in Eloquent JS are getting harder.

### Day 5: January 9, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Read chapter 4 of http://eloquentjavascript.net/ and worked through the exercises at the end ofthe  Chapter. 

**Thoughts:** Exercises seem to be going well. It could be interesting to compare the demo code results with the code that I'm using to complete the exercises. Not going to peek yet so I don't spoil the surprise.

### Day 4: January 8, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday was my break day for the week.

Read chapters 3 and 4 of http://eloquentjavascript.net/. Also re-worked the exercises at the end of Chapter 3: Looping a triangle, FizzBuzz, and Chess board. 

**Thoughts:** My confusion about functions has somewhat cleared up but I have to admit that recursion can be a big bit to wrap your head around.

### Day 3: January 6, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Read and worked through GitHub 'Hello World' Guide to see how commits and pull requests work. Now, I've updated and logged my progress here.

Read the Introduction and first two chapters of http://eloquentjavascript.net/. Also completed exercises at the end of Chapter 2: Looping a triangle, FizzBuzz, and Chess board. Figured I needed some 'back to basics' as I was having some confusion with functions and callbacks in a general sense.

**Thoughts:** Really cool code editor within and among the text of eloquentjavascript which encourages the reader to "consume" the coding examples by making changes to the given code and see how the output changes in response. Love the style of writing! Good progress was made today on basic JS.

### Day 2: January 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Random Quote Generator

**Thoughts**: Took a while to figure out it's harder to convert XML output to JSON, so will read up and re-do.

### Day 1: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Joined Twitter as @FinLizzy5. Following fellow 100DaysofCode FCCers, among others.

**Thoughts** I started Free Code Camp in November 2016 and have really enjoyed my progress so far. Just started the Intermediate Front End Dev Projects which should jive with 100 Days of Coding!
